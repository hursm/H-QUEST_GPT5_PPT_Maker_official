# H-QUEST Deployment Checklist

To deploy your H-QUEST presentation (e.g., to a web server or sharing as a zip), you need to include the following files and folders in the same directory as your HTML file.

## 1. The Presentation File
- [ ] **`your_presentation.html`** (The HTML file generated by the AI)

## 2. System Folder (`H-QUEST/`)
You must include the entire `H-QUEST` folder containing the core logic and styles.
- [ ] **`H-QUEST/`**
    - `app.js` (Core logic + Chart.js helpers)
    - `presentation-data.js` (Template definitions)
    - `template-renderer.js` (Rendering engine)
    - `style.css` (Light theme)
    - `style-dark.css` (Dark theme)
    - **`libs/`**
        - `chart.min.js` (Chart.js library)

## 3. Assets Folder (`assets/`)
If your presentation includes images or videos, they must be in an `assets` folder as referenced in your HTML.
- [ ] **`assets/`**
    - **`images/`** (For user-provided images)
        - e.g., `logo.png`, `screenshot.jpg`
    - **`videos/`** (For local video files)
        - e.g., `demo.mp4`
